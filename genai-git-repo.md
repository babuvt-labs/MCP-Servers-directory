# 🚀 Introducing GitMCP: Instantly Turn Any GitHub Repo into an AI-Ready MCP Server

AI-assisted development is moving fast, but giving your AI assistant *real-time, up-to-date* knowledge of your codebase can be tricky—until now. Meet [GitMCP](https://gitmcp.io/): a free, open-source tool that instantly transforms any GitHub repository into a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for your favorite AI coding tools.

## What is GitMCP?

**GitMCP** makes it easy for AI assistants to access and understand the documentation and code in any public GitHub project (or GitHub Pages site). All you have to do is change your repo’s URL—no installs, no config.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero Configuration**  
  No setup or installation. Just change `github.com` or `github.io` in your URL to `gitmcp.io`.

- **Instant MCP Endpoint**  
  Examples:  
  - `https://github.com/username/repo` → `https://gitmcp.io/username/repo`  
  - `https://username.github.io/repo` → `https://username.gitmcp.io/repo`

- **Deep AI Context**  
  Lets AI tools access `README.md`, docs, and code using files like `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`.

- **Works With Your Favorite Tools**  
  Compatible with MCP-enabled AI tools such as Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, VSCode, Cline, Highlight AI, Augment Code, and more.

- **Open Source & Private**  
  No tracking, no data storage. Self-host for private/internal codebases.

## 🚦 How to Use

1. **Make Your MCP URL**  
   Swap `github.com`/`github.io` for `gitmcp.io` in your repo URL.

2. **Configure Your AI Assistant**  
   Point your AI tool to the new GitMCP URL as its custom MCP endpoint.

3. **Enjoy Smarter AI Coding**  
   Your AI assistant now sees your repo’s *real* context—live, every time.
