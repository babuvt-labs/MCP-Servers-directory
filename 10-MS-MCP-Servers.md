## Getting Started

These MCP servers can be set up in **VS Code** (with Agent mode) or **Visual Studio 2022** (version 17.14 or later) . Each server requires specific configuration including connection strings and authentication, but follows a consistent setup pattern across both IDEs .

The servers leverage the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** standard, enabling vendor interoperability and allowing developers to mix and match tools from different vendors in their AI workflow .
